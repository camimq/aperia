## Apperia´s Project

Apeperia has an innovative way to build apps for small e medium-sized companies.

Its main proposal is to delivery a solution developing apps with low maintainance cost.

## Focus on responsiveness

This project was developed to practice and learn more about responsiveness. It is available at [Alura´s Platform](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/mobile-first-layouts-responsivos). During the whole proccess I was guided by [Matheus Alberto](https://github.com/ikyrie).

## Extra Take aways

The main focus on this course was responsiveness, however, all the tips given were as valuable as the subject of the course.

### Emmet

I´ve learn how to build complex structures using Emmet and therefore, increasing productivity and saving time.

### Good practices

During the whole course we were presented to good practices and why those are important. Because of this training, I became and advocate of good habits like, for example, code planning. This practice not only save time when you are coding, but also helps to predict problems and write cleaner and more predictable code.

### CSS variables

I´ve heard about CSS variables before, but up untill now, hadn't looked for more information. During this course, we worked with them and the little we did, was enough to know that I will want to know more in the near future.

### Units of measure

- `rem` e `em`: the diferences, how to use them and when to use them. Need more practice but now, I can say that I´ve got that!  😄

### HTML Tags

Everyone says that HTML has more than just the most common tags. It´s true. And it is amazing how we just ignore the power they have when we start studying programming. During this course "I´ve met" `<video>`, `<address>` and few others. Have implemented some of them and... well, it is a must!
